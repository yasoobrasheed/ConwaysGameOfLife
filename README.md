# ConwaysGameOfLife

Virtual enviornment that runs on the iPhone 6 simulator. 
Conway's Life is a 0-player game that explores specific interactions between different grid squares or "live cells" to create patterns and creatures and a civilization at a large scale. This simulator runs on a 10x10 grid so civilizations don't grow advanced. But patterns still emerge!
