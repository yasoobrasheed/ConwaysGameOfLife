## ConwaysGameOfLife
Conway's Life is a 0-player game that explores specific interactions between different grid squares or "live cells" to create patterns and creatures and a civilization at a large scale. This simulator runs on a 10x10 grid, so civilizations don't grow too advanced. 

## Motivation
I was 17 and thought it was cool that you can "play" a 0-player game, so I wanted to explore this a bit.
